### robot question
UPER
- can move if have values either side
- cannot move if a lowest/highest value
- can compare - only with item immediately in front/behind it
- can swap (tell which one is bigger)
- binary flag for the light on/off

- bubble sort algo
if compare == 1, swap item

drop items to the first None before current location



light is on when list is ordered

if robot holding nothing and can't move right, light off
